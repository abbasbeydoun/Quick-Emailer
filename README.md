# Quick-Gmailer
Quick-Gmailer is code written in python that allows you to log in and send a quick text e-mail to anybody you want

This python code successfully connects to gmail and sends an e-mail through that service

This is just a simple program to practice my skills and apply my knowledge



NOTE: If you are someone using this code for your e-mail, remember to enable access for less secure apps in your g-mail settings so that logging in through the program can work.
